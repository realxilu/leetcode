# AIM TO PERFECT THE SKILL AND BE ALL YOU CAN BE

Nomenclatures and conventions in this repo:
- i, j, k: for indexing. 'i' is usually the index from left, 'j' the index from right. 'k' comes after 'j' if present
- left, l, right, r: also for indexing, less common than 'i', 'j', but still in use
- m, n: m = length for row, n = length for col
- row, col: same as above
- x, y: for content in the collection (as opposed to the indices above)
- slow, fast: slow and fast pointers
- _list, l: list
- dic: dictionary i.e. dic = {}
- s, _set: set ie s = set()
- q: queue based on python's deque
- heap: prioirty queue based on python's heapq

Shorthand notations:
- res = result set / list 
- ans = answer set
- dfs = depth first search / any backtracking algorithms
- bfs = breath first search
- cur = cur node or pointer
- lvl = level

Python:
use _ for list comprehension where the item is a placeholder and not used

Commonly used functions:
- append - add to the last element (same as javascript's _push_)
- pop - pop the last element
- popleft - pop the first element
- heappushpop
- heappop
- x in dic, x in set
- [0] * len(nums)
